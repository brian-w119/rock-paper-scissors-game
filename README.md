# rock-paper-scissors-game
My first attempt at creating a game of "Rock, paper, scissors:
The aim of this game is to have the human user play against the computer.
The user will choose either "rock", "paper", or "scissors" first.
The user input will be insensitive to case. 
 The computer will then make a random choice of one of the three items.
If the computer and user make the same choice, an error message will be displayed.
The winner of each round is announced. Five rounds will be played.
